# lottery

This project was created out of boredom.

It contains three packages:
1. lotteries: This package contains three different classes. Each one creates random numbers for the three lotteries *Lotto 6 aus 49*, *Eurojackpot* and *KENO*.
2. lotto_numbers: This package contains all drawn numbers (txt file) of the three mentioned lotteries since their first drawing (KENO is outdated).
3. sorting_algorithm: This package contains a class that sorts a two-dimensional array. This is used for sorting the numbers that has been drawn since they are not sorted.
